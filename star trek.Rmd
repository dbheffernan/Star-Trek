#Demographics
"I'll never get used to seeing a woman on the bridge." -Captain Christopher Pike. Star Trek: Season 1,episode 0 (1966)

Perhaps the biggest obstacle to using IMDB to understand Star Trek fandom is that IMDB users and Star Trek fans are signifigantly different.  Now, IMDB actually breaks down ratings by sex and age, meaning, in theory, we could adjust the ratings to match the demographics of the larger Trekkie community.  However, going down this path we quickly run into the highly contentious issue of who exactly counts as a fan?  With over a dozen1 projects rumored to be in development as of early 2019, franchise owner National Amusements no doubt has extensive proprietary research into exactly who constitues a Trekkie.  While the information is not availible to the general public, we can get a decent sense from availible data.

##Gender
To be blunt, the classic image of the male science fiction nerd is not accurate based on all availible data.  Surveys indicate the science fiction/fantasy fandom community is at least (Eventbrite2) 49% of are female, with more rigorus academic works citing higher numbers of 54.5 (Menadue and Jacups) or 57 (Frazetti).  Frazetti in particular is noteworthy, as his survey was explicity of star trek fans.  Less rigours Facebooks surveys conducted by the author and Shencker both indicate aproximetly 1/3 of the fandom is female.  Finally, while not quantifiable, we should consider signaling from the franchise owners.  Large sci-fi properties such as Star Trek and Star Wars are expensive to produce and owned by very large highly profitable media companies.  If the classical image of the mal-adjusted male nerd were accurate portrayal of those companies target audiences, it is reasonable to assume they would not be spending lavish amounts of money to create properties featuring non-sexulized female leads and complex female friendships.  Based on the availible data, it is reasonable to conclude that, like the population at large, about half of trekkies are female.

While not directly applicable to our purposes as IMDB only breaks down ratings demographics into male and female, surveys indicate that 1.1 (Menadue and Jacups), 2(Eventbrite), and 1.9 (Heffernan) percent of fandom identifies as some form of non-binary gender.  While surveys vary considerably, this is in all likelihood signifigantly higher than the population at large, estimated in a 2017 meta-survey by Meerwijk and Sevelius as aproximetly .4%.

(HOW GENDER OF SAMPLE COMPARES)
##Age
Age is decidedly trickier to nail down.  Before we begin it should be noted that IMDB breaks their age demographics into the groups under 18,18-29,30-44,45+.  Under 18 tends to have very low numbers of people and will be dropped for our purposes.  Rigorus studies show an aproximate breakdown of 1/3 in each of the 3 catagories lised abobe.  Specifically,  Frazetti (32,31,37), Menadue and Jacups (20,37,42).  The less rigorus surveys such Heffernan and Shencker both indicate a somewhat younger audience, with the 45+ group being the least numerous.  A key unexplored factor is how the dates the surveys were collected.  One could imagine surveys conducted in the period after Enterprise went off the air, but before the Kelvinverse movies were released having a signifigantly older skew. 

##What this means
Ultimetly, we are looking at 6 demographic catagories, which could roughly be described as men/women who came of age before TNG, during the run of TNG, DS9 or VOY, and after Voyager.  Based on availible evidence I am comfortable giving these 6 groups equal weight in our model.  The data indicates that in all liklihood the percentages are something close to that.

#Shape of Data
#Insights
#1: TNG is way worse than you remember
Our dataset includes ratings for both the overall series, as well as indivdual episode.  Presumably, people only form their opinion of the the overall series after viewing each episode and carefully considering the entire run holistically.

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(digest)
library(tidyverse)
series <- tbg%>%group_by(series_name)%>%summarise(IMDB_Series_Average = mean(series_avg))%>%arrange(desc(IMDB_Series_Average))
kable(series)

```

Of course, most people probably don't make a carefully considered decision after watching each episode.  Rather, the series rating could be more accurately considered a measure of fan's senitment for the series.  Indeed, the above lists probably more or less matches what one would guess the rankings are after viewing the general discourse on the internet.  If we look at the series on a per episode basis, we get a very different picture.

```{r}
 
kable(tbg%>%
        group_by(series_name)%>%
        summarise(mean = mean(demo_adj),
                  sd = sd(demo_adj),
                  skew=skewness(demo_adj))
      %>%arrange(desc(mean)))
```

This is not terribly surprising if one is familiar with some of the dregs of TNG.  For every classic and rightly celebrated episode such as "The Best of Both Worls", "The Inner Light", "The Measure of a Man" or "Yesterday's Enerprise" there is a "Angel One" (Feminist Police State Planet), "Code of Honor" (Offensive African Sterotype Planet), "Sub Rosa" (Crusher Has Sex With a Ghost), or "Shades of Grey" (We Ran Out of Money and Need to Make the Season Finale a Clip Show).  It should be noted that these episodes are spread out over the series, as we can see in this graph of average ratings for each season.
,e
```{r}
seasons <- tbg %>% 
  group_by(series_name,seasonNumber) %>% 
  summarise(IMDB_season_mean = mean(demo_adj),
            sd=sd(demo_adj))
p<-ggplot(data=seasons, 
          aes(x=seasonNumber, 
              y=IMDB_season_mean, 
              group=series_name,
              colour = factor(series_name))) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()

target <- c('Star Trek: The Next Generation','Star Trek: Voyager')

seasonst <- tbg%>% 
  filter(series_name %in% target) %>%   
  group_by(series_name,seasonNumber) %>% 
  summarise(IMDB_season_mean = mean(demo_adj),sd=sd(demo_adj))
pp<-ggplot(data=seasons, 
           aes(x=seasonNumber, 
               y=IMDB_season_mean, 
               group=series_name,
               colour = factor(series_name))) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = IMDB_season_mean - (sd), 
                  ymax = IMDB_season_mean+(sd),
                  fill=series_name,
                  colour = factor(series_name)))

Clearly we say an improvement in TNG starting around the third season, but even then the quality is not stand out compared to the other shows from the 90s.  Furthermore, we see a rather percipitous drop in quality in the final season, most likely caused by a lot of the creative team leaving for other shows (explored below).

We can actually compare the shows in a more rigorus way than simply looking at the means, using a statistical test known as "Student's T-Test".  While this is not the place to really get into weeds as to how all this works, essentially the T-Test compares the means of two samples (in our case, Star Trek series) and tells us the likelyhood that difference between those means is "statisically signifigant" or simply the result of random chance.  This liklihood is expressed in the form of a "p-value," essentially the probability that the different between the means is the result of random chance or a true difference between the samples.  If this "p-value" below a certain level, traditionally 0.05 (or a 5% liklihood of being random) we can say it is "statisically signifigant." It should be noted, again for reasons we don't need to get into, that only "low" p-values matter.  For example, with a sufficiently low value we can say the mean of A is *not* higher than the mean of B, but a high value comparing B and C doesn't tell us that B is better than C.  Let's take a look at how this all stacks up when we compare the mean of each show.

```{r}
# ttests %>%
#   ggplot(aes(x = series_a
#              , y = series_b
#              , fill = pval)) +
#    geom_raster() +
#   geom_text(aes(label = round(pval,digits=2))) +
#   scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Spectral"
#                        , limits = c(0,1)) +
#   theme_minimal()+
#   theme(panel.grid = element_blank())

ttests %>% 
     arrange(series_b) %>%
     group_by(series_a) %>%
     filter(row_number() != which(series_a == series_b)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=series_a, y=series_b, fill=pval)) +
    geom_tile() +
   geom_text(aes(label = round(pval,digits=2))) +
    scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Spectral"
                        , limits = c(0,1)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, hjust=TRUE)) +
    xlab("is better than this one") + 
    ylab("probabily this show")
```

As we can see, TNG's p-values are suffciently low that we can "reject the hypothsis" that it has a higher mean episode than any other series, and VOY's fall into that range when compared to DSC, ENT, and DS9.  In English, we can say the average episode of TNG is almost certainly worse than every other series, and the average episode of Voyager is worse than the three listed above.

#2: Showrunners tend to be good writers

Next, we shift from the Star Trek series to the people that worked on them.  Particularly for the 90s era shows, many of the crew members would work on multiple shows.  Perhaps while there might not be a huge difference between overall series quality, but that because breakout stars like Byran Fuller or Naren Shankar worked on multiple series.  Or perhaps real turkies like the fan loathed Brannon Bragga dragged down rankings across multiple series.  Using statistial regresstion on IMDB's crew database can perhaps give us a sense.

Essentially, statisical regresstion in a machine learning algorithm that estimates what the impact of one variable (in our case crew member) is on a second variable (IMDB score).  It does this by looking at the entire dataset and estimating what the impact of one crew memeber's contribution would be were we to hold all other variables constant.  For example, while the directors, story editors and showrunners he worked with varied, the episodes that Michael Piller wrote, such as the "Best of Both Worlds" tended to be pretty good.  When we do this across the entire creative team of the six core shows, we get a decent idea of what the rankings are.  As before, statistical significance is key.  While there are aproximetly 600 people that have worked on the creative team of Trek at some point or another only a handful (21) are standouts at the 95% confidence level.
